### P. Founding Timeline Clarification

Based on multiple sources, Civil Maps has several relevant dates:

- **October 2012**: Anuj Gupta's LinkedIn shows start date as Co-founder/Engineer
- **2013**: First contracts with railroad companies (3D mapping for train control)
- **2013**: Started working with LiDAR data (heavy industries: railroads, pipelines)
- **2014**: Scott Harvey's role as Founder and Senior Engineer begins
- **2015**: Formal company founding as Civil Maps (Solfice Research, Inc.)
  - Pivot focus from railroad to autonomous vehicles
  - UC Berkeley SkyDeck program
  - Founder.org Class of 2015 ($100K funding)
- **2016**: Public emergence with Ford seed funding

**Interpretation**: The team began working together on 3D mapping technology for railroads in 2012-2013 under an earlier entity or project. The formal incorporation as "Civil Maps" targeting autonomous vehicles occurred in 2015, which is the widely cited founding date.
