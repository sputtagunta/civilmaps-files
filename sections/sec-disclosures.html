    <h3>Key Observations</h3>

    <div class="disclosure-item" style="border-left-color: #e67e22;">
        <div class="disclosure-text">
            <p><strong>What Luminar Disclosed:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>Acquisition completed on June 15, 2022</li>
                <li>Assets expected to advance software development capabilities</li>
                <li>Treated as asset acquisition (not business combination) under ASC 805</li>
                <li>Substantially all fair value attributable to acquired technology</li>
                <li>374,193 shares of Class A Common Stock issued</li>
                <li>Civil Maps technology to be used for vehicle localization and HD mapping</li>
                <li>Operations integrated into Autonomy Solutions segment</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>What Luminar Did NOT Disclose in SEC Filings:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>Total cash consideration paid (if any)</li>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><em>Note: The §220 books and records action filed in Delaware Court of Chancery suggests that there may be significant additional information about compensation arrangements, stockholder voting, and potential conflicts of interest that were not disclosed in Luminar's public SEC filings.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Critical Disclosure Gaps: Vote Cleansing Requirements</h3>

    <div class="disclosure-item" style="border-left-color: #e74c3c;">
        <div class="disclosure-text">
            <p><strong>Context: The Corwin Cleansing Standard</strong></p>
            <p>For the Solfice stockholder vote to "cleanse" potential conflicts under Delaware's <em>Corwin</em> doctrine, stockholders needed <strong>full and fair disclosure</strong> of all material facts before voting. The §220 case alleges critical information was withheld. Based on court filings, here's what appears to be missing from Luminar's public disclosures:</p>

            <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">1. Employment Agreements as Closing Conditions (APA §7.2(e))</h4>
            <p><strong>What the §220 Case Reveals:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>The Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) Section 7.2(e) listed <strong>employment agreements with Stefan Safko and Scott Harvey</strong> as explicit <strong>closing conditions</strong></li>
                <li>Both Safko and Harvey were <strong>Solfice board members with fiduciary duties</strong> to all stockholders at the time of the transaction</li>
                <li>Their employment agreements being closing conditions means the deal could not close without securing their personal employment with Luminar</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>What Luminar Disclosed:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>❌ <strong>Nothing</strong> about employment agreements</li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure that board members would become Luminar employees</li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure that their employment was a closing condition</li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure of compensation terms for these board members</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Why This Matters for Vote Cleansing:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #c0392b;">
                If Solfice stockholders were not informed that board members voting on the transaction would receive employment agreements as a condition of closing, they could not properly assess whether those directors' votes and recommendations were conflicted. This is material information that could affect the validity of the stockholder vote under Corwin.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">2. RSU Awards to Insiders and Directors</h4>
            <p><strong>What the §220 Case Reveals:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>Multiple Solfice insiders received <strong>Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) awards</strong> in Luminar stock as part of the transaction</li>
                <li>Recipients included <strong>Stefan Safko</strong> (board member), <strong>Scott Harvey</strong> (board member), and <strong>Satya Vakkaleri</strong></li>
                <li>These RSUs represented <strong>additional consideration beyond the pro rata distribution</strong> to common stockholders</li>
                <li>RSU awards may have been structured as "release agreements" providing separation benefits</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>What Luminar Disclosed:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>✓ <strong>374,193 shares</strong> of Class A Common Stock were issued "in connection with the acquisition"</li>
                <li>❌ No breakdown of <strong>who received these shares</strong></li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure that <strong>board members received RSU awards</strong></li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure of the <strong>vesting terms</strong> or <strong>valuation</strong> of RSUs</li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure distinguishing between <strong>transaction consideration</strong> vs. <strong>employment compensation</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Why This Matters for Vote Cleansing:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #c0392b;">
                Under Corwin, votes from "interested" stockholders (those receiving side benefits) do not count toward the cleansing majority. If directors and insiders received RSUs that were not disclosed to voting stockholders, their shares may need to be excluded from the vote tally. The §220 complaint alleges this could reduce the 54% approval to below 51%.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">3. Alleged Voting Inducements to Major Stockholders</h4>
            <p><strong>What the §220 Case Reveals:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>Plaintiffs allege that <strong>Fabien Chraim</strong>, a major common stockholder with significant voting power, may have received <strong>undisclosed compensation</strong> in exchange for voting yes</li>
                <li>If true, this would represent a <strong>voting inducement</strong> that should have been disclosed to all stockholders</li>
                <li>The §220 demand specifically seeks records about compensation or benefits provided to Chraim</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>What Luminar Disclosed:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>❌ <strong>Nothing</strong> about compensation to any individual Solfice stockholders</li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure of <strong>voting agreements</strong> or <strong>voting inducements</strong></li>
                <li>❌ No disclosure of any <strong>side deals</strong> with major stockholders</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Why This Matters for Vote Cleansing:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #c0392b;">
                Delaware law requires disclosure of all material facts before a stockholder vote. If a major stockholder received undisclosed benefits in exchange for voting yes, that is quintessentially material information. Non-disclosure of voting inducements can invalidate the vote and eliminate Corwin protection, potentially exposing the transaction to entire fairness review.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">4. Related Party Transactions and Conflicts of Interest</h4>
            <p><strong>What the §220 Case Reveals:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>No special committee of <strong>independent directors</strong> was formed to evaluate the transaction</li>
                <li>Directors with <strong>personal financial interests</strong> (employment, RSUs) appear to have participated in approving the transaction</li>
                <li>Potential <strong>self-dealing</strong> by fiduciaries who stood to benefit beyond their pro rata share</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>What Luminar Disclosed:</strong></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #c0392b;">
                Stockholders voting on a transaction need to know if their fiduciaries have conflicts of interest. When directors stand to personally benefit from a deal, stockholders must be informed so they can properly evaluate whether the transaction is truly in the company's best interest or whether it benefits insiders at the expense of common stockholders.

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #c0392b;">
                Stockholders cannot make an informed decision without knowing the total value of the transaction and how it compares to the company's worth. If insiders received a disproportionate share of the consideration through employment agreements, RSUs, and other side benefits, that reduces what's available for common stockholders and is material to their voting decision.

                <strong>Critical Conclusion:</strong> Luminar's SEC filings disclosed the <em>existence</em> of the Civil Maps acquisition but omitted critical details about compensation to insiders, employment agreements as closing conditions, and potential voting inducements. These omissions are precisely what the §220 books and records action seeks to investigate, as they are material to determining whether the Solfice stockholder vote validly "cleansed" the transaction under Delaware law.
